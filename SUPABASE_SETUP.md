# Supabase Setup Guide for Ell-ena Team ID System

This guide explains how to set up Supabase for the Ell-ena application's Team ID system.

## 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and sign in or create an account
2. Create a new project with your preferred name and database password
3. Wait for the project to be created (this may take a few minutes)

## 2. Set Up Database Schema

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to the SQL Editor
2. Create a new query and paste the contents of the `supabase_schema.sql` file
3. Run the query to create all necessary tables, policies, and functions

## 3. Configure Authentication

1. In your Supabase project, go to Authentication â†’ Settings
2. Under Email Auth, make sure "Enable Email Signup" is turned on
3. Customize the email templates if needed

## 4. Set Up Environment Variables

1. Copy your Supabase URL and anon key from the project settings
2. Update the `.env` file in your Flutter project with these values:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## 5. Test the Setup

1. Run the Flutter application
2. Try creating a new team and verify that:
   - A 6-character team ID is generated
   - The team ID is displayed in a dialog with a copy button
   - The team is created in the Supabase database
3. Try joining an existing team and verify that:
   - The team ID is validated
   - Users can only join if the team ID exists
   - Users are properly associated with the team in the database

## Database Schema

### Teams Table
- `id`: UUID (primary key)
- `name`: Text (team name)
- `team_code`: Text (6-character unique team ID)
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `created_by`: UUID (user who created the team)

### Users Table
- `id`: UUID (primary key, linked to auth.users)
- `full_name`: Text
- `email`: Text (unique)
- `team_id`: UUID (foreign key to teams.id)
- `role`: Text ('admin' or 'member')
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `updated_at`: Timestamp

## Row Level Security (RLS)

The database uses Row Level Security to ensure that:
- Users can only view their own team's data
- Only team admins can update team information
- Users can update their own profiles

## Team ID Generation

Team IDs are 6-character alphanumeric codes (e.g., A06OUI, X7K9L2) that are:
- Automatically generated when creating a new team
- Validated when joining an existing team
- Unique across all teams
