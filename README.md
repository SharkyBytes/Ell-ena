## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision

Imagine a world where staying productive is easy and smart. Instead of juggling different apps for tasks, tickets, and meeting notes, users can simply talk to Ell-ena â€“ and it takes care of the rest.

Ell-ena understands natural language commands and turns them into structured tasks, tickets, or notes with context-aware automation. Whether you're a developer, student, or manager, Ell-ena fits right into your workflow and grows with your needs.
